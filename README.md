# Edwards PC Tool Control Interface - Advanced Drive GUI

## About
The aim of this project is to provide Edwards Vacuum Ltd with a software application that allows for connection and control of drives and their parameters, operating vacuum pump hardware. The new software is an upgrade from the current software and feature the ability to remotely update, communicate with a database for storing drive configurations, sharing them over the network, and a log-on system to regulate user access (e.g., preventing unauthorised users from modifying drive parameters). To facilitate these functions, a server is necessary to store new versions, the database, and run software to communicate with other computers.
